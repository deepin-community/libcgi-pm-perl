libcgi-pm-perl (4.15-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream Changes, 4.15:

    - This release removes the AUTOLOAD and compile optimisations from CGI.pm
      that were introduced into CGI.pm twenty (20) years ago as a response to
      its large size, which meant there was a significant compile time penalty.

    [...]

    - This essentially deprecates the -compile pragma and ->compile method. The
      -compile pragma will no longer do anything, whereas the ->compile method
      will raise a deprecation warning. More importantly this also REMOVES the
      -any pragma because as per the documentation this pragma needed to be
      "used with care or not at all" and allowing arbitrary HTML tags is almost
      certainly a bad idea. If you are using the -any pragma and using arbitrary
      tags (or have typo's in your code) your code will *BREAK*

    - Although this release should be back compatible (with the exception of any
      code using the -any pragma) you are encouraged to test it throughly as if
      you are doing anything out of the ordinary with CGI.pm (i.e. have bugs
      that may have been masked by the AUTOLOAD feature) you may see some issues.

  From upstream Changes, 4.13:

    - CGI::Pretty is now DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future release.
      Please see GH #162 (https://github.com/leejo/CGI.pm/issues/162) for more
      information and discussion (also GH #140 for HTML function deprecation
      discussion: https://github.com/leejo/CGI.pm/issues/140)

  CGI::Fast is split out into its own distributin upstream, and is available
  in Debian as libcgi-fast-perl (recommended by libcgi-pm-perl).

  4.03 features the following notice in Changes:

    [ REMOVED / DEPRECATIONS ]
    - the -multiple option to popup_menu is now IGNORED as this did not
      function correctly. If you require a menu with multiple selections

libcgi-pm-perl (3.59+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [BUG FIXES]
  We no longer read from STDIN when the Content-Length is not set, preventing
  requests with no Content-Length from freezing in some cases. This is consistent
  with the CGI RFC 3875, and is also consistent with CGI::Simple. However, the old
  behavior may have been expected by some command-line uses of CGI.pm.

libcgi-pm-perl (3.55-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
  url() was fixed to return "PATH_INFO" when it is explicitly requested
  with either the path=>1 or path_info=>1 flag.

  If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are calling
  self_url() or you are calling url() and passing path_info=>1, these methods
  will actually be returning PATH_INFO now, as you have explicitly requested,
  or has self_url() has requested on your behalf.
